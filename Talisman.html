									<h2><u>Talisman</u></h2>
										<p>“I have my teddy bear with me,” she whispered. “You can’t hurt me.”</p>
										<p>The monster paused, halfway between her closet and where she stood beside her bed. It hovered 
										a few inches above the ground, a formless mass of yellowed bandages, and appeared to study her, its 
										ligatures writhing like snake tongues tasting the air.</p>
										<p>She thrust the bear toward it as if it were a sword. “I’m thirsty,” she said in a slightly louder 
										voice, fighting back tears. “I’m going to get a drink.”</p>
										<p>The monster drifted closer. It stopped just in front of her outstretched hand, so close that she 
										could feel the warm breath of its presence against her fingers. She forced herself to hold still as 
										its bandages surrounded her bear, never quite touching it, getting close and then recoiling as if 
										burned by its matted plush brown fur. After a moment, it retreated with an indignant rustling noise, 
										and she could feel it glaring at her.</p>
										<p>She gave a triumphant nod and brought the bear back to her chest.</p>
										<p>The wooden floor of the hallway was cold against her bare feet, the white linoleum of the kitchen 
										floor colder still. As she approached the sink, she felt something thin and damp graze the back of her 
										neck.</p>
										<p>“Stop it!” she hissed, turning and shoving her bear toward the monster.</p>
										<p>Its bandages snapped back against it so that it briefly held the shape of a near-perfect sphere. It 
										swept to the other side of the kitchen to sulk, and she couldn’t resist smiling. She filled her glass 
										from the faucet and faced the monster as she drank. When she was done, she let out an exaggerated sigh 
										of satisfaction and wiped the back of her hand across her mouth.</p>
										<p>“Alright. I think I can sleep now,” she announced.</p>
										<p>She strode back to her bedroom, the monster keeping its distance as it followed her. It watched from 
										the foot of her bed while she crawled under the covers. As she laid her head on her pillow, it suddenly 
										occurred to her that she might let go of the bear while she slept; she’d found it on the floor more than 
										a few times when she woke up in the morning. She thought for a moment, and then she untied her bear’s bow 
										tie and wrapped it around her wrist as a bracelet. She held it up to show the monster and grinned when it 
										snapped its bandages in irritation.</p>
										<p>“Night-night,” she whispered.</p>
